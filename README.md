Impressed?
============

* Built with [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js). Check my presentation if you don't know about this tool!
* Color Scheme inspired by [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
* Pie Chart embedded with [graphael](http://g.raphaeljs.com/)


Feel free to fork it, and use it as an example for your own presentation. You can also find [other examples here](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/wiki/Examples-and-demos), and [an official demo here](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/).
